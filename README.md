Three-Level Password System

Overview

The Three-Level Password System is a console-based Python application designed to enhance security by requiring users to pass through three different levels of authentication. 
Each level uses a distinct method to verify the user's identity, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to gain access.

Features

Level 1 - Textual Password Authentication: The user is prompted to enter a textual password.
Level 2 - Graphical Password Authentication: The user is required to enter a predefined pattern (e.g., "L-shape").
Level 3 - Security Question Authentication: The user must answer a security question correctly.

## How It Works

1. Textual Password: The first layer of security involves entering a simple textual password. If the password is correct, the user moves on to the next level.
2. Graphical Password: The second layer asks the user to enter a specific pattern (e.g., "L-shape") that represents a graphical password.
3. Security Question: The final layer involves answering a security question correctly. If the answer is correct, the user gains access.
